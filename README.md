<h1 align="center">Ang9CustomPipe</h1>

I was working on another project that needed a custom pipe.  Tried using one from a previous project and couldn't get Angular to recognize the pipe. I created this repo to get things working.  

So I had created the custom pipe (filter). Imported and added it to my modules declarations. Imported and added it to my components providers and it still would not work.  

As it turns out I just needed to include the FormsModule in my main module (app.module).   It is not necessary to add the filter directly to the component you are using it in.  

Learn from my mistakes - I won't make this one again.  Happy coding.
